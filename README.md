# PyTorch implementations of Memory-Augmented Neural Networks

- NTM/DNC
- DND/LSTM-DND/MRA
- RTS
- MNM

With application in:

- Meta Learning (abstract reasoning)
- Reinforcement Learning

## TODO

- [ ] Representation loss: CPC
- [ ] Representation loss: VAE (MERLIN)
- [ ] Variational addressing
- [ ] EBMM
- [ ] General dataset interface
